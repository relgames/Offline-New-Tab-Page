Offline-New-Tab-Page
====================

Google recently updated Chrome's New Tab page to include annoying links to Google services. Their implementation of this causes the page to be loaded from the internet each time a tab is created, causing it load slowly and use your internet connection unnecessarily. This extension blocks that page from loading so that Chrome defaults to the offline version of the New Tab page, which loads more quickly, does not use your internet connection, and removes those annoying links. Since this extension does not replace the New Tab page but rather redirect it, you will still have your bookmarks bar at the top of the page.

The icon for this extension is taken from [http://www.iconarchive.com/show/oxygen-icons-by-oxygen-icons.org/Actions-tab-close-icon.html] under the GNU Lesser General Public License.
